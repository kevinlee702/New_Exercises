      <h1>One of the things I really love is Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.  Besides getting exercise and learning to defend yourself.  It embodies similar themes from DevBootCamp in that being a good programmer involves more than just coding.  It teaches that improving your mind, being able to have self control, and watching what we eat to be healthy is Jiu-Jitsu.  </h1>

      <h2>Inside the Lab</h2>
      <p>AlgorithmiicLabs started out from the love of Jit-jitsu and Coding. The mission is to spread both to the world.  Helio Gracie once said if everyone knew Jiu-Jitsu no one would fight each other. Coding has been absent from many school's curriculum.  Let's spread the joy and the world will be filled with coders who can change the world and people who have a healthy mindset through Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
